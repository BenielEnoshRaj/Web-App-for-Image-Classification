Made use of VGG16 model and fine-tuned it to fit the dogs_vs_cats image dataset.
Made use of GlobalMaxPooling layer to shrink the number of parameters by a large margin
~138 Million Parameters ---> ~15 Million Parameters

But Retaining the accuracy of the original model as convolutional layers contribute to most of the learning in CNNs.
